# Pathfinder
Simple pathfinding demo.

The program allows to test the path finding algorithm.
Breadth-First Search was selected as the best algorithm, but A* and Dijkstra implementations with tests are also available in the code.

The user selects the map size and can then place obstacles randomly or manually. Finally, you can mark the start and target points of the path. In response, you receive a drawn path and general information about the result.

It is also possible to test the path by letting a runner out on it.
